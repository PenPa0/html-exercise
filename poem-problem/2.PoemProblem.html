            I think that I shall never see
            A poem lovely as a tree.
            
            A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
            Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
            
            A tree that looks at God all day,
            And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
            
            A tree that may in Summer wear
            A nest of robins in her hair;
            
            Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
            Who intimately lives with rain.
            
            Poems are made by fools like me,
            But only God can make a tree.
